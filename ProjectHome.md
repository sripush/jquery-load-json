# JQuery loadJSON plugin #
This is a JQuery plugin that enables developers to load JSON data from the server and load JSON object into the DOM. No templating language is required - this plugin matches DOM elements in the HTML page with a JSON object using a DOM element properties.

# Usage #
To use loadJSON plugin two items should be defined:
  * HTML code that will be used as template
  * JSON object that will be used to populate template

## HTML template ##
Template is plain HTML code. Only requirement is that elements that should be populated must have id, name, class, or rel attributes that have matching properties in the JSON object. Example of HTML template is shown below:
```
        <div id="data">
            <h1 id="Name"></h1>
            <label for="Address">Address:</label>
            <span id="Address"></span>	
            <label for="Contact">Contact by:</label>
            <span id="Contact"></span>
        </div>
```

In the template h1 tag with id Name, and span tags with ids Address and Contact will be populated with JSON properties.

## JSON object ##
Once HTML template is defined JSON object that will be used to populate template must be defines. Example of object that can populate template shown above is shown in the following listing:
```
        data = {
                    "Name":"Emkay Entertainments",
                    "Address":"Nobel House, Regent Centre",
                    "Contact":"Phone"
        }  
```
Object has three properties (Name, Address, and Contact) that will be injected into the template.

## Binding JSON object to the template ##
Once HTML template and JSON object are defined, JSON object can be loaded into the HTML code. This can be achieved using the following line of JavaScript code:
```
        $('div#data').loadJSON(data);
```
As a result 'data' object will be loaded into the HTML fragment with id data. Resulting HTML is shown in the following listing:
```
        <div id="data">
            <h1 id="Name">Emkay Entertainments</h1>
            <label for="Address">Address:</label>
            <span id="Address">Nobel House, Regent Centre</span>	
            <label for="Contact">Contact by:</label>
            <span id="Contact">Phone</span>
        </div>
```
